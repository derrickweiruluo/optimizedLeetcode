Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.

"""
dp[i][j] means the size of biggest square with A[i][j] as bottom-right corner.
dp[i][j] also means the number of squares with A[i][j] as bottom-right corner.

If A[i][j] == 0, no possible square.
If A[i][j] == 1,
we compare the size of square dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 is the maximum size of square that we can find.
